For Magento Community Edition 1.9

Magento extension which lets user store a webcam image for each order (image of the final package). 
The image is stored using the orderID (not increment ID) on the server and is available via the normal orders backend in magento. 
It should work with any webcam connected to the pc/mac using html5.
